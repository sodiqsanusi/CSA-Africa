    "## Functional programming\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming languages are designed to let us express a solution to a given problem. Of course, different languages can support this in different ways. Most of the common programming languages let us describe our solution using a list of steps, or instructions, that are worked through one-by-one, in order: these are _procedural_ languages. For the most part, the Python code that you'll have written is likely to be in the procedural style. Python also allows us to write _object-oriented_ programs, where we instantiate objects, and manipulate them. This is another way of expressing a solution to a problem that we want to solve.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, there are _declarative_ languages, where we describe the problem that needs to be solved, and leave it to the programming language implementation to solve it. For example, you might have used SQL if you've worked with databases. In that language, we would specify a query in terms of the results we want. The SQL implementation then figures out how best to deliver those results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, there is the _functional programming_ paradigm. As the name suggests, functional programs are composed of a set of functions. These functions take input, and produce output, and don't maintain state. Some languages enforce these restrictions strictly: these are _pure_ functional languages. Pure languages have the benefit of producing programs that can be formally proven to be correct: that is, we _could_ construct a mathematical proof that demonstrates that the program is accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other languages, like Python, let us combine some aspects of the functional style with other paradigms, like procedural and object-oriented. This lets us benefit from some of the other advantages to this style. Breaking our programs down into functions, for example, often makes it easier to solve the problem: writing small functions is easier than writing large programs. These small functions can be combined together to solve the bigger problem, and they're often easier to test and debug.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable us to write functional programs, Python treats functions as _first-class objects_. In essence, this means that we can treat functions as we would other values of other types. So, we can assign a function to a variable:"

We won't cover iterators further in this tutorial, but you can [find more information here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#typeiter).
