    "## Using files to store data\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we've either hard-coded data into our programs, or we've allowed the user to enter it using their keyboard (with `input()`). Of course, if we want to work with larger data sets, we'll need a better way of getting data into and out of our programs. Python allows us to read and write to _files_ stored in the computer's _filesystem_.\n",
    "\n",
    "Storing data as files has a number of benefits. Files are persistent, so the data they contain remains even when your computer is switched off. They're also easy to share with others, allowing data to be uploaded for use by others. Finally, the computer's filesystem provides a built-in way of organising files into folders.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you've worked with files in other programming languages, you'll know that it can sometimes be tricky. We first need to open the file, by giving a _path_ to its location. We can then read and write to the file. And finally, we need to make sure that we _close_ the file once we're finished, so that all of the changes we make are saved properly.\n",

The `open` function returns an object that represents the file, and `as phonebookFile` assigns this to the variable called `phonebookFile`. We haven't covered objects in this track, but for now all we need to know is that we can perform operations (like reading and writing) on the file via the object assigned to `phonebookFile`. Finally, the `with` statement opens a block where it is valid to access the file via `phonebookFile`. The file will be closed once the `with` block has finished. That means that the above example safely opens the file, reads a line from it, and closes it.\n",

    "We can see that the memoised version of our function was much quicker than the non-memoised version. Indeed, this can have very significant consequences on the runtime of our program. We can use the memoised version of our function to calculate really large Fibonacci numbers: try the snippet above with the number 5000, for example. But for our non-memoised version, the time taken to calculate each number in the sequence increases exponentially: you'll be there for a long time if you use it to calculate the 5000th Fibonacci number.\n",
    "\n",
    "While `time` is useful to show what's going on in a general sense, there are a lot of factors that can affect the results we get, including the hardware of the computer we're using, and the other software running on the computer at the same time. In track 2 next week, we'll see a better, more scientific approach to reasoning about time complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Memoisation essentially swaps time complexity for space complexity: storing all of those Fibonacci numbers for use later on takes up memory in our computer. We need to think about whether or not this is a worthwhile trade-off, depending on the problems we want to solve."
